1) in the game events screen, change the Game Clock bar to be called "Scoreboard Bar". The scoreboard bar should also include a game score, using  the format "{team A score} : {team B score}" 

2) When in playback mode, the game score in the scoreboard bar should be synchronised with the video playback time. At the start of a game, the score for both teams is 0. The game score for a given video playback time can be calculated by iterating through game event records with a wall clock time that is earlier than the video playback time.

For a 'score' event, both team A and team B scores should be set according to the score event data 

For succesful ft,pb,dunk,2pt,3pt events, the score for the team that event record relates to shall be incremented by 1 for 'ft' event, 3 for '3pt' events, and 2 for '2pt', 'pb', 'dunk' events.


3) in the game events screen, if  the user attempts to leave the screen (or reload the page) when event records have been added but not yet saved, add a confirmation prompt before leaving/reloading

4) when an event record has been added or edited, check it is valid before letting the user move to another record, or go back to playback mode. If the record is not valid, prompt the user whether to discard the record, or continue editing it
